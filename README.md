# Example Config

Example Emacs configuration for clojure development with cider and clj-refactor.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository as your `~/.emacs.d/` directory (or alternatively copy the contents into your `.emacs.d`)
2. copy the provided `profiles_sample.clj` to your `~/.lein/` directory and rename it to `profiles.clj` (again alternatively just merge the contents of the sample profiles.clj with your existing profiles.clj if you already have one)

Alternatively you can cherry pick packages and/or config from here for clojure development with cider and clj-refactor and add it to your already existing `~/.emacs.d` directory.

Either way you should be able to `cider-jack-in` on any clojure file of your favourite clojure project with `C-c M-j`. Prefix for clj-refactor is set to `C-c RET` so for example introduce let would be `C-c RET i l`.

Happy clojure hacking!

## Package versions

Our dependencies largely come from MELPA Stable, which aims to hold only stable versions of packages. The main exception is `clj-refactor` and its dependencies. clj-refactor is available on MELPA Stable, but it has a very out-dated version.

### Using Emacs package management

Where possible, we make use of a helper function, require-package, that checks if a package is installed locally. If it is not installed locally, it will attempt to download and install that package from the package repositories. When you first use this config, Emacs will download all of the requirements that are not included with this configuration (i.e., the ones that we do not get from MELPA stable).

[Here is a link](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_package_system.html) to more detailed information about package management in Emacs.

## Rationale

See [this issue](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/issues/110) for the discussion which resulted in creating this sample configuration. The goal of this to provide a reference Emacs config which is specially focused on clojure development with all the bells and whistles but does not have much else in it.
